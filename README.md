> Change the resolution of multiple monitors to the maximum supported by a given Display Memory Limit

Remote desktop clients often have a maxium display memory that they support without all sorts of issues springing up. 
Companies often have policies that reduce this limit even further, possibly to save on bandwidth. 
As displays get better, more people will be hitting this limit and facing issues that they do not know how to solve. 

This windows app will automatically calculate the optimum combination of resolutions that your monitors and company's display memory limit support.

It was built to work with the Citrix Display Memory Limit and provide a quick solution for anyone else that faces this problem!
